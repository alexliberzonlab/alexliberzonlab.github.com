# PIVIR

**Particle Image Velocimetry and Infared Tomography** for the characterization of coherent structures in the near-wall region 

We investigated the flow field in a turbulent boundary layer in a flume, by using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Hot-Foil Infrared Imaging (HFIRI) techniques. Coherent patterns in the flow were identified and characterized by using instantaneous velocity and temperature fields. The velocity fields in the streamwise–spanwise plane were measured in parallel to the temperature distribution of the flume bottom. The identified patterns are represented by means of their spatial characteristics – a non-dimensional spatial separation between streamwise patterns, \lambda^+.
