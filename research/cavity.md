title: Lid driven cavity flow

### Why lid driven cavity flow is interesting

CFD-online wiki:

> The lid-driven cavity problem has long been used a test or validation case for new codes or new solution methods. The problem geometry is simple and two-dimensional, and the boundary conditions are also simple. The standard case is fluid contained in a square domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions on all sides, with three stationary sides and one moving side (with velocity tangent to the side).

### Our study
We focused on two aspects of the 3D lid driven cavity flow:

1. Lagrangian description of a quasy-2D flow in the cubic cavity
	* see the poster of Reut Elfassi
    
2. Experimental and numerical study of the low Reynolds number instability
	* [Yuri Feldman](http://directory.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/search.cgi?uid=yurifeld), ex-Ph.D. student of Prof. Alex Gelfgat has studied the instability using their home-made DNS solver. We have verified the instability in our experimental system, more info is available from the manuscript: [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0449) and Physics of Fluids, Volume 23, Issue 8, pp. 084106-084106-7 (2011)
