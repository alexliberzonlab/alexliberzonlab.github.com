# Two-phase

## Two-phase flows of solid particles in liquids

### Why?

![][1] ![][2]



### What?

What we do not really know is: 



1.  Coupling between the flow and the solid particle motion: 
    *   one- or two-way coupling? 
    *   what's important beyond the Stokes number? 

This strongly affects our ability to model the two-phase, particulate flows on the computer and be sure that what we model really works 



### How?

We can **double** the [3D-PTV][3] system, that can capture **500 frames per second (fps)**, capture and store the images for about 10 minutes of the experiment. We can use another system, for example based on a single high-speed camera of 2000 fps and the four-mirror view splitter ([See it here][4]) and take measurements of the liquid phase (our usual flow tracers that diffract a green light) and the solid phase (solid particles of Silica Gel that are roughly 500 micrometers in diameter and have density of 1.4 gr/cm3). 

  


Below you can watch the video clip of our forcing machine with the two kinds of particles (tracers and solid particles) in action:
