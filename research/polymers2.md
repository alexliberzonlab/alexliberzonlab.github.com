### **Turbulence in dilute polymers**

This the research project that started during the postdoctoral period at the ETH Zurich. The work is performed in close cooperation with the Swiss group of Dr. Michele Guala, Dr. Beat Luethi, Prof. Wolfgang Kinzelbach and with the direct connection to Prof. Arkady Tsinober. Later we had Dr. Markus Holzner joining our efforts. The results are published in Physics of Fluids in 2005, 2006 and 2009 papers and in numerous conferences and meetings. 

**Goals** 

1.  The main goal was (it still is) a comparative study of the small scale properties of a quasi-isotropic turbulence in a Newtonian fluid (water) and in dilute polymer solution (up to 100 wppm) 
2.  The research is done primarily by using three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry (3D-PTV) system, allowing to measure the velocity field, the field of velocity derivatives in time and in a Lagrangian manner. 
3.  The expectation is to identify the influence of polymers on the fields of strain, vorticity, dissipation, enstrophy and their production in turbulent flows. 

**Experimental setup** 

The quasi-isotropic and homogeneous flow is produced by 8 counter-rotating disks on two opposite walls of the following apparatus. The scheme on the right shows the direction of rotation of 4 disks on one wall, in so-called “four-mill” configuration.

The flow is seeded with 30 micron polystyrene particles and it is illuminated by 20 Watt CW Ar-Ion laser.

The observation volume is of 10 x 10 x 10 mm and it the tracer motion is recorded with 4 CCD cameras:
