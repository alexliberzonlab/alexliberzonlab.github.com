# TwoPhaseETH

## Two-phase flows of solid particles in liquids (by no means "past" - see the Ongoing projects)

IFU has purchased the second 3D-PTV system, that can capture 500 frames per second and store the images for about 10 minutes of the experiment. We combine this system with another system, based on the single, high-speed camera of 2000 frames per second and the four-mirror view splitter and take measurements of liquid phase (our usual flow tracers that diffract a green light) and solid phase (solid particles of Silica Gel that are roughly 500 micrometers in diameter and have density of 1.4 gr per cubic centimeter).
