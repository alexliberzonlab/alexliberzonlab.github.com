The main research topics are turbulent flows in natural and industrial applications. Moreover, our speciality is in accurate measurements of velocity derivatives in Eulerian and Lagrangian settings, using either multi-hot-wire or 3D particle tracking technology. We also implement our methods to unsteady flows (pulsating, periodic, etc.) of air and liquids in cooling applications, micro-electronics industry applications (coating, etching, etc.), bio-medical applications and resuspension of particulate materials from smooth and rough walls. 

Few examples are given below:
