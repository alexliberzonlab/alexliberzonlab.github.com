title: Pulsating flows in compliant tubes
---


The pulsating flows in compliant pipes is very complex system in which the flow is unsteady, inhomogeneous and strongly and bi-directionally coupled with the elastic motion of the flexible enclosure. This creates most difficult situation in which parametrization and experimental study is of utmost importance.
