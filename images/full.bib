  abstract = {Drag reduction by dilute polymer solutions is the most recognized
	phenomenon in wall-bounded turbulent flows,which is associated with
	large scales (e.g.,velocity scales) in spite of a consensus that
	polymers act mainly on much smaller scales of velocity derivatives.
	We demonstrate that drag reduction is only one sort of polymers'effect
	on a turbulent flow and show how turbulent velocity and velocity
	derivatives are altered in the presence of dilute polymers,irrespective
	of drag reduction phenomena. This is an experimental study on the
	interaction of dilute polymers with a complex three-dimensional turbulent
	flow with small mean velocity gradients. Lagrangian data (e.g.,velocities
	and velocity gradients) of flow tracers were obtained by using three-dimensional
	particle tracking velocimetry in an observational volume in the turbulent
	bulk region,far from the boundaries. The focus is on aspects related
	to the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) production,\^a\"E\^a€ \^a\^a‚¬\^a„¢uiujSij
	(ui is the fluctuating velocity,uiuj is the Reynolds stress tensor,and
	Sij is the mean rate-of-strain tensor),such as an anisotropy of Reynolds
	stresses and the alignment of the velocity vector field with respect
	to the eigenframe of Sij,among others. We base our study on the comparison
	of turbulent quantities in flows of water and of dilute polymer solution,forced
	in two distinct ways: frictional forcing by smooth rotating disks
	and inertial forcing by disks with baffles. The comparison of the
	results from the water and from the dilute polymer solution flows
	allows a critical examination of the influence of polymers on the
	TKE production,viscous dissipation,and the related turbulent properties.
	We conclude with (i) quantification of the direct effect of polymers
	on the small scales of velocity derivatives,(ii) evidence of an additional
	dissipation mechanism by the polymers,which is the main reason for
	the strong inhibition of the viscous dissipation,2s2,in a turbulent
	bulk,(iii) verification that TKE production does not change if the
	energy input to the flow is at the scales that are not affected by
	polymers (e.g.,inertial forcing or a very rough wall),and last,(iv)
	evidence for qualitative modification of the turbulent structure,which
	is not exhausted by the additional dissipation mechanism. \^A\^A\^A©2006

	is investigated numerically. Spatial characteristics of the large
	scale structure are presented through an original method,proper orthogonal
	decomposition (POD) of the three-dimensional vorticity fields. The
	DNS results,obtained by Tiselj et al. [23] for a fully developed
	turbulent flow in a flume,are used in the present work to analyze
	coherent structures with the proposed methodology. In contrast to
	the reconstruction methods that use instantaneous flow quantities,this
	approach utilizes the whole dataset of the numerical simulation.
	The analysis uses one thousand 3D vorticity fields from 50000 time
	steps of the simulation for the Reynolds number of 2600 (the turbulent
	Reynolds number Re*=171). The computational domain is 2146\~A\^a\^a‚¬\^a€?171\~A\^a\^a‚¬\^a€?537

	points (in streamwise,wall-normal and spanwise directions,respectively).
	Experimental results obtained by using particle image velocimetry
	(PIV) in a fully developed turbulent boundary layer in a flume,which
	were analyzed with the same statistical characterization method,are
	in agreement with the DNS analysis: the dominant vortical structure
	appears to have a longitudinal streamwise orientation,an inclination
	angle of about 8\^A\^A\^A°,streamwise length of several hundred wall
	units,and a distance between the neighboring structures of about
	100 wall units in the spanwise direction.},

  abstract = {Regions of negative turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) production are
	observed and studied in two different flows,namely in turbulent thermal
	Rayleigh-B\~A\^A\^A©nard convection in a cubic cell,and in a mechanically
	agitated shear flow in absence of buoyancy,with a main focus on the
	small scale structure of the flow. The experimental investigation
	is performed using three-dimensional (3D) particle tracking velocimetry,which
	allows for measuring the three velocity components and the full tensor
	of velocity derivatives in a finite 3D volume. The capability to
	compute the TKE production term in its complete form P=\^a\^a\^a€\v
	s\^A¬\^a\^a‚¬\oe uiujSij is crucial due to the three dimensionality
	of the flows. A comparative analysis of four different flow situations
	is performed in regions with positive and negative TKE production
	with and without buoyancy effects. In both,convective shear flow
	and shear flow without buoyancy,negative TKE production is associated
	with the unusual,more pronounced alignment of the velocity vector
	u with the first eigenvector 1S"align="middle">of the mean rate-of-strain
	tensor,related to the stretching eigenvalue,1S"align="middle">,in
	contrast to the positive TKE production associated with the alignment
	with the third eigenvector (i.e.,related to the negative,compressing
	eigenvalue). In the negative TKE production region of convective
	flow we find (i) increased values for mean strain,(ii) increased
	values of the first contribution P1 in the eigenframe of the mean
	rate-of-strain tensor,and decreased values of the vertical contribution
	to the production term in a fixed frame of reference,(iii) stronger
	anisotropy of u,(iv) higher levels of fluctuating strain s2 and enstrophy
	2,as well as (v) higher rates of their production,\^a\^a\^a€\v s\^A¬\^a\^a‚¬\oe
	sijsjkski and ijsij,compared to the respective values in positive
	TKE production region. In the shear flow without buoyancy,all the
	mentioned quantities are lower in the negative TKE production region
	than in the positive TKE production region. From this we conclude
	that the inverse energy transfer in the shear flow case without buoyancy
	is associated with depletion of the field of velocity derivatives.
	This does not occur in the cubic Rayleigh-B\~A\^A\^A©nard convection
	cell. In this flow,buoyancy is observed to have an effect on three
	levels: the field of velocity derivatives,velocity fluctuations,and
	the mean flow field. It is inferred that buoyancy is able to maintain
	a region with the negative TKE production by acting on all these
	levels simultaneously. \^A\^A\^A©2005 American Institute of Physics},
