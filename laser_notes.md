*   Built-In optics for beam combination 
*   Internal or external triggering 
*   Synchronized or independent triggering for each oscillator

1.  safety measures 

For any emergency cases, push on the EMD red button that found on the supplier. In addition for general safety it recommended to turn off the general electric switch of the laser in the Lab. 



*   Laser maintenance 

Dew measure of the laser is introducing on the laser box by silica gel (Fig.2). The values of the dew are 20% to 60%. While silica gel colored pinkish its means absorbance of dew in the laser box. It’s very important to keep on the laser surrounded clean. Cooling unit connected to the laser and keep on required temperature of the system. Values of cooling system should be conductivity of 3-4 and flow of 5 l/min. It is recommending replacing the silica gel and all the filter of the cooling unit every 6 months.

*   Spatial Beam profile

*   The control of the system will be done throw the supplier panel (Fig.5).

To begin, you will turn on the general electric switch of the laser, followed by the key switch. Different Commands can be selected on the Menu. When starting up the system you will need to increase the current power on the menu (explanation shows up later). The supplier panel includes two control modules, one per laser. The system can run with one pulse or more by enter delay value. 

All the different switches are in ‘on’ mode always, except the laser switch (shutter) and the key switch. 

Internal or external triggering is an option in the control system. For internal trigger or one external trigger (will be connecting from the back of the supplier), choose the ‘single trig’ option. For two external trigger there is necessary to replace the switch for ‘dual trig’. 

For any kind of unbalance system, red light will turned on. Try to push on ‘Fault Reset’. 

Menu Display: 

Value of the required electric current flow will show up on the display after turning the 

‘Shutter’ switch. 

Long push on upward arrow button introduces how many laser we would like to work on. Usually we will work on both lasers. ‘Setting’ – Temperature, Current (until 36A for 1kH, until 30A for 0.5kH),Offset (show the default current values of min Amper per laser, with constant difference of offset between of them, Mode (choose PRF, then there are two options ‘INT/EXT’ for internal trigger the supplier requires transformation of frequency). 

Alex’s notes: 

1.  Distilled water – once a month 
2.  Filters inside the chiller unit: 2 times per year – we have at least once on warranty. Check if we need to purchase those: 
    *   Particles filter 
    *   deionization filter 
    *   silica gel 
3.  Single trigger – delay is set by the delay counter 

Dual trigger – each head gets its own trigger signa 

Conductivity measure at the bottom of the chiller – if it’s 7 – stop and call service 

Control: 

To shut one of the lasers off or turn both on: from the main display, press arrow UP (^) and get to the menu of Both ON, One off, Two Off 

Menu -> Settings -> Set temp -> 23 C (default) 

Menu->Settings->Current = MAXIMUM 36 A@ 1 Khz 

At lower frequency: 30 A @ 500 Hz 

At the installation, the parameters were: 

78 Watt @ 3 kHz, 36 A 

27.7 Watt @ 0.5 kHz, 30 A (> 50 mJ) 

laser 1 = 14 Watt, 30 A @ 500 Hz 

laser 2 = 13.5 W, 30A @ 500 Hz 

The picture of the beams is shown above 

Order power meter of ophir: L40(150)A SH-V2 + extra cooler (thermal detector), ~ 2000$ incl. reader.
