title: After OpenPTV meeting

---

## The OpenPTV meeting is over, see http://www.openptv.net

So the meeting is over and we would like to thank all our lab members that helped to make it so successful, especially Yosef Meller and Hadar Traugott. Thanks to Mark, Alon and Ron who took some part and thanks to our alumni, Mark Kreizer who came to give a talk on his thesis topic.
