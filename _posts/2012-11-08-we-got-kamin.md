## Kamin fund from the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Industry, Trade & Labor 

Our laboratory, in collaboration with [Daphne Weihs](http://www.bm.technion.ac.il/~daphnew) from the Technion and [Roi Gurka](http://www.bgu.ac.il/~gurka/) from Ben Gurion University, got the "Kamin" fund to develop the in-line, real-time rheometer based on the flexible blade (patent pending) technology.
