The easiest way is to look at the Github source of the pages <https://github.com/alexliberzonlab/alexliberzonlab.github.com> and create a copy of one of those. It's so easy to fork the whole directory and change/add something and send back the pull request, that it will take us a second to merge it and automatically build the site.
