<p>
    Welcome to the <a href="http://turbulencelab.github.com"> new website for the Turbulence Structure Laboratory </a>.  I've
    revamped the site to bring it up-to-date with what we're working on.  I've
    also migrated the site over to <a
    href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/">Jekyll</a> (<a
  href="http://github.com/turbulencelab/turbulencelab.github.com/">my fork</a>), which I highly recommend for the organization sites.

Big plans, short in time ...
