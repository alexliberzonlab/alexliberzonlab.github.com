### Two Ph.D. positions for the international students (June 2016)

1. Lagrangian dynamics of inertial particles crossing turbulent/non-turbulent interface
1. Lagrangian dynamics of inertial particles crossing turbulent/non-turbulent interface


**Funding**

[Alex Liberzon Laboratory](http://goo.gl/AxBCv) research focuses on the key mechanisms of turbulent flows. We are one of the partners in the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action, sponsored by the Horizon 2020 EU program, abbreviated as "COMPLETE". 

Contact Prof. Alex Liberzon directly for more details.  


**Location**


The work will be carried out at the School of Mechanical Engineering, Tel Aviv University.

**Requirements**


We are looking for a passionate Ph.D. student with a good background in fluid mechanics. Optical flow-measurement techniques experience will be preferred. The Ph.D. candidate should have a MSc in physics, mechanical, chemical, aeronautical or civil engineering. Good written and oral communication skills in English are required. Hebrew language skills are not necessary.

**Conditions of employment**

Upon fulfilling an entrance conditions of a Ph. D. position at the Tel Aviv University, you will get the status of a regular Ph.D. student with an appropriate scholarship for 4 years with an optional extension to 5th year.
