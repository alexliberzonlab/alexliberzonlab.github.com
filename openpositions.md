## Two early research positions for the international researchers or returning Israeli citizens (Sep 2016)


Applications are invited for *14 ESR positions* (“Early Stage Researchers”) to be funded by the Marie-Sklodowska- Curie Innovative Training Network “COMPLETE – Cloud-MicroPhysics-Turbulence-Telemetry: An inter-multidisciplinary training network for enhancing the understanding and modeling of atmospheric clouds within the Horizon 2020 Programme of the European Commission. COMPLETE is a consortium of high profile universities, research institutions and companies located in ltaly, France, Germany, Israel, Poland and UK. See job announcement on [EURAXESS](http://ec.europa.eu/euraxess/index.cfm/jobs/jobDetails/34099915)

### Two positions are at Tel Aviv University (and one at industry, see below) 


**ESR 7: Lagrangian properties of aerosol parcels at the turbulent/non-turbulent interfaces with density
jumps**
Objectives: Experimental and numerical based estimates of "apparent diffusivity" of particles and fluid parcels
crossing the turbulent/non-turbulent interfaces with density jumps.
Expected Results: Parameterisation and a model of the spreading rate and "apparent diffusivity" constants as a
function of density jump, and particle-related parameters (Reynolds, Stokes).


**ESR 8: Development of the multi-MEMS-sensor-probe for the three dimensional turbulent velocity and
vorticity measurements at sub Kolmogorov scales in atmospheric turbulent flows and clouds**

Objectives: Design and development of a multi-sensor probe based on the unique MEMS-based technology,
providing multi-component measurements of turbulent properties in atmospheric turbulent flows and in clouds.
Expected Results: A set of MEMS-based probes based on different design with adaptation for in-flight vs stationary
measurements, hardware and software development for the rapid probe deployment.

Host: [Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv-Yaffo, Israel](https://english.tau.ac.il/)

**Benefits and salary**

The successful candidates will receive an attractive salary in accordance with the MSCA regulations for Early Stage Researchers (http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/) in the form of a scholarship.

The exact salary will be confirmed upon appointment and is dependent on the country correction fac­tor (to allow for the difference in cost of living in different EU Member States). The salary includes a living al­lowance, a mobility allowance and a family allowance (if already married). The guaranteed PhD funding is for 36 months. In addition to their individual scientific projects, all fellows will benefit from further continuing education, which includes internships and secondments, a variety of training modules as well as transferable skills courses and active participation in workshops and conferences.

**Eligibility criteria**

Applicants need to fully satisfy three eligibility criteria:

Early-stage researchers (ESR) are those who are, at the time of recruitment by the host, in the first four years (full- time equivalent) of their research careers. This is measured from the date when they obtained the degree which formally entitles them to embark on a doctorate, either in the country in which the degree was obtained or in the country in which the research training is provided, irrespective of whether or not a doctorate was envisaged.
Conditions of international mobility of researchers: Researchers are required to undertake trans-national mo­bility (i.e. move from one country to another) when taking up the appointment. At the time of selection by the host organization, researchers must not have resided or carried out their main activity (work, studies, etc.) in the country of their host organization for more than 12 months in the 3 years immediately prior to their recruitment. Short stays, such as holidays, are not taken into account.

English language: Network fellows (ESRs) must demonstrate that their ability to understand and express them­selves in both written and spoken English is sufficiently high for them to derive the full benefit from the network training.

#### Additional position is available in collaboration with industry:

**ESR 13: Research and investigation of the performance limits of a direct detection Lidar system developed
at PTL, in highly turbulent atmosphere and in real and artificial turbulent environment.**
Objectives: Experimental and theoretical research on ways to improve the performance of a wind and aerosols Lidar
in highly turbulent environment, and inside or in the vicinity of clouds and fog at different density levels.
Expected Results: Algorithms and software tools to handle accurate wind measurement and aerosols density in
high turbulent flow and high density environment such as fog and clouds. These algorithms and software tools will
be implemented and tested in Pentalum's SpiDAR technology and potentially in other Lidar systems.
