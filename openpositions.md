### Ph. D. position at the Turbulent Structure Laboratory, Tel Aviv University

### Energy transfer in turbulent flows with dilute polymers


**Research**

[Turbulence Structure Laboratory](http://goo.gl/AxBCv) research focuses on the key mechanisms of turbulent flows. In this particular study performed in collaboration with the group of [Prof. Bettina Frohnapfel](http://www.isl.kit.edu/558_519.php) from the Institute of Fluid Dynamics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, dilute polymers are used as triggers to the intrinsic changes in energy transfer across turbulent scales of motion. On the smallest turbulent length scales, dilute polymers get stretched and relaxed at very high frequencies, thus affect smallest vortices, show higher concentrations in regions of high strain, and, in turn, influence the turbulent flow itself on all the scales. Polymer molecules and turbulent flow fields mutually interact, showing peculiar behaviour of both phases. On larger, macroscopic length scales, mean shear and spatial velocity gradients influence the dynamics of the dilute polymer alignments and total rate of stretching. The subprojects in this collaborative research program address a variety of aspects concerning energy transfer mechanisms in turbulent flows with laboratory experiments (Tel Aviv) and numerical simulations (Karlsruhe).

**Job description**


This PhD project concerns an experimental study of the dynamics of turbulent flows w/o dilute polymers. There is a great need for optical techniques to characterize the dynamics of both the fluid and the polymer molecules. We plan to use the three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry (http://www.openptv.net) using fluorescent marked polymers and flow tracer particles to measure the turbulent velocity field and the stretching rates of polymers. This project focuses on the characterization of the turbulent velocity and velocity gradients fields in the quasi-homogeneous turbulent flows. 

**Location**


The work will be carried out at the Turbulent Structure Laboratory, School of Mechanical Engineering, Tel Aviv University. The project is supervised by [Prof. Alex Liberzon](http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~alexlib) and co-advised by [Prof. Bettina Frohnapfel, KIT](http://www.isl.kit.edu/558_519.php).

**Requirements**


We are looking for an passionate Ph.D. student with strong experimental skills and a good background in fluid mechanics. Optical flow-measurement techniques experience will be optimal. The Ph.D. candidate should have a MSc in physics, mechanical, chemical, aeronautical or civil engineering. Good written and oral communication skills in English are required. Hebrew language skills are not necessary.

**Conditions of employment**

Upon fulfilling an entrance conditions of a Ph. D. position at the Tel Aviv University, you will get the status of a regular Ph.D. student with an appropriate scholarship for 4 years with an optional extension to 5th year. Scholarship will be extended to the senior Ph.D. student level from the research grant by the Germany-Israel Science Foundation. Student visa to Israel is required.
