## Open positions

### Ph.D./M.Sc. student, starting from January 2013

* Experimental research of turbulent flows with dilute polymers
* The student will work in a research collaboration with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. During the study few visits to the German partner are planned. 
* This research is funded by the German-Israel Science Foundation (GIF). 
* Experimental methods: three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry  [3D-PTV](http://3dptv.github.com) and particle image velocimetry [PIV](http://www.openpiv.net). 
* Design a new experimental setup that will help to study the effects of dilute polymer solutions (polyethylene oxide and similar long chain high molecular weight drag reducing additives) on the turbulent shear flows (jets, wakes, boundary layers).
