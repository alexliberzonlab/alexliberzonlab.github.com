### Two early research positions for the international researchers or returning Israeli citizens (June 2016)

See the job announcement on [EURAXESS](http://ec.europa.eu/euraxess/index.cfm/jobs/jobDetails/34099915) 


Applications are invited for *14 ESR positions* (“Early Stage Researchers”) to be funded by the Marie-Skłodowska- Curie Innovative Training Network “COMPLETE – Cloud-MicroPhysics-Turbulence-Telemetry: An inter-multidisciplinary training network for enhancing the understanding and modeling of atmospheric clouds within the Horizon 2020 Programme of the European Commission. COMPLETE is a consortium of high profile universities, research institutions and companies located in ltaly, France, Germany, Israel, Poland and UK. See job announcement on [EURAXESS](http://ec.europa.eu/euraxess/index.cfm/jobs/jobDetails/34099915)

**Position titles**: 

1. Lagrangian dynamics of inertial particles crossing turbulent/non-turbulent interface
1. Micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) based sensor for turbulent flows
1. Additional position is available in collaboration with a small enterprise (industry) [Pentalum](http://www.pentalum.com/), contact them for more details. 


Objectives: Development of numerical tools and methods in conjunction with experiments to study dynamics of droplets and 
particles crossing turbulent/non-turbulent interfaces and microscopic sensors for turbulence measurements


**Expected Results**: 

1. Simulations and measurements of particle trajectories across the turbulent/non-turbulent interface
1. Development of the new MEMS sensor technology

Host: [Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv-Yaffo, Israel](https://english.tau.ac.il/) 

Contact person: Prof. Alex Liberzon, [alexlib@eng.tau.ac.il](mailto:alexlib@eng.tau.ac.il)

Benefits and salary

The successful candidates will receive an attractive salary in accordance with the MSCA regulations for Early Stage Researchers (http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/) in the form of a scholarship.

The exact salary will be confirmed upon appointment and is dependent on the country correction fac­tor (to allow for the difference in cost of living in different EU Member States). The salary includes a living al­lowance, a mobility allowance and a family allowance (if already married). The guaranteed PhD funding is for 36 months. In addition to their individual scientific projects, all fellows will benefit from further continuing education, which includes internships and secondments, a variety of training modules as well as transferable skills courses and active participation in workshops and conferences.

Eligibility criteria

Applicants need to fully satisfy three eligibility criteria:

Early-stage researchers (ESR) are those who are, at the time of recruitment by the host, in the first four years (full- time equivalent) of their research careers. This is measured from the date when they obtained the degree which formally entitles them to embark on a doctorate, either in the country in which the degree was obtained or in the country in which the research training is provided, irrespective of whether or not a doctorate was envisaged.
Conditions of international mobility of researchers: Researchers are required to undertake trans-national mo­bility (i.e. move from one country to another) when taking up the appointment. At the time of selection by the host organization, researchers must not have resided or carried out their main activity (work, studies, etc.) in the country of their host organization for more than 12 months in the 3 years immediately prior to their recruitment. Short stays, such as holidays, are not taken into account.
English language: Network fellows (ESRs) must demonstrate that their ability to understand and express them­selves in both written and spoken English is sufficiently high for them to derive the full benefit from the network training.
