Find your way to the laboratory, walking East between the Wolfson building of the Faculty of Engineering and the Student classes building (“בניין כיתות”). You can ask about the way to the new students' auditorium no. 020 or to the mechanical workshop. You'll find the lab under the red light (don't enter if it's on) and the sign **Turbulence Structure Laboratory** as it is shown below.
