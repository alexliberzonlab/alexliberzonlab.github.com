### Welcome to the Turbulence Structure Laboratory


Turbulence Structure Laboratory successfully developed the **Multi-Hot-Cold-Wire Anemometry** probe and implemented to the study of the structure of turbulence in high Reynolds number flows. The laboratory has extended its research activity to the non-intrusive experimental methods such as **Particle Tracking Velocimetry''', **Particle Image Velocimetry** and **Infrared imaging**. Recently we also developed a novel micro-hot-film-probe to cope with the sub-Kolmogorov scales of turbulence.  



We investigate *turbulence*: 
> *Turbulence* it is a disordered motion of fluid that has enormous practical importance. We believe that detailed experiments, jointly performed with the numerical simulations and leaded by the theoretical predictions will help us gaining better insight into the structure of turbulence. 


See example notes of our new *Advanced Measurement Methods in Fluid Dynamics and Heat Transfer* [Courses].
