Cooling of PC using unsteady convective heat transfer 

We have transparent PC case with installed air flow ventilation, see the images: 

![][1] ![][2] ![][3] ![][4] ![][5] ![][6]

The project is experimental: 

*   Make the air cooling system working with an external controller that enables to turn on/off any combination of the air flow ventilators 
*   Make flow visualization with smoke or aerosols 
*   Measure the flow in the case 
*   Analyse and propose for an optimal configuration of air fans.

Four view opto-mechanical image splitter for the single-camera high speed tracking system 

An opto-mechanical design and construction is needed for the system that will allow to replace the four (4) camera system with a single camera. This could be done through a spitter that by the system of aligned mirrors splits the single view into multiple views.
