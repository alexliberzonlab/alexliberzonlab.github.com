## Reut Elfassi

Reut is graduated from the School of Mechanical Engineering in 2006 and joined the laboratory as our first Master student. Reut was responsible for the lid-driven cavity experimental setup and the three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry measurement technique. During the studies she visited the Monash University (Melbourne, Australia) and worked in the group of Prof. Julio Soria on the two-dimensional turbulent flow research using particle image velocimetry (PIV).
