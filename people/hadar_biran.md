# HadarBiran

Hadar Biran is working on bio-medical fluid mechanics problem. The project is a collaboration between the TSL, Dr. Idit Avrahami and the Interventional Cardiology Department at the Rabin Medical Center (Beilinson). 

Hadar will use the experimental system constructed by [Dikla Kersh][1] and re-constructed by [Katya Barishev][2] to experiment and develop the novel blood flow measurement technique based on imaging modalities.
