Lilly Verso is our guest from Polytechnico Di Torino. He's working on his masters degree project at the laboratory of Prof. Daniela Tordella <http://areeweb.polito.it/ricerca/philofluid/people/72-daniela-tordella.html> and visits the Turbulence Structure Laboratory under the IAESTE students exchange program.

Update: Lilly Verso successfully graduated in July 2013. We're looking forward seeing him among our Ph. D. students, working on stratified turbulence.
