# HadarTraugott

Hadar works on the resuspension of solid particles in turbulent environment. Turbulent flow picks up the solid particles lying on the bottom with and without mean flow (or mean shear). This aspect is not known as good as the resuspension in fixed or moving beds of flowing channels. The question whether different mechanisms of resuspension are observable experimentally.

3D trajectory of a lifted particle from the moment of pick-up and to the full resuspension.
