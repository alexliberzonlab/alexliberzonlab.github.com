Hadar Traugott works on the resuspension of solid particles in turbulent environment. Turbulent flow picks up the solid particles lying on the bottom with and without mean flow (or mean shear). This aspect is not known as good as the resuspension in fixed or moving beds of flowing channels. The question whether different mechanisms of resuspension are observable experimentally.
